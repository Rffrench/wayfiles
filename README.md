# About Wayfiles
Wayfiles is a tool designed to search for juicy files and URLs within a folder/file with results of tools like `gau`, `waymore`, `waybackurls`, etc.

üëâüèª Many URLs that are archived in the Wayback Machine, Common Crawl or AlienVault may still be live and accesible, which is specially valuable if you are a Bug Hunter. Also, if you encounter files that are not live anymore, you can still try accesing them using any of the previous services mentioned. Maybe you find some old credentials in some archived file or something valuable that can still be abused today.

In order to use `wayfiles`, you only need to specify a folder with results or a file with URLs and Wayfiles will do the rest.

Wayfiles was also designed to be pipable to other tools such as `httpx`. Only specify the `-s` flag and pipe the results found to check which URLs are still live.

**NOTE:** `wayfiles` does not scan the Wayback Machine or other services. The tools I mentioned already do a great job for that. `wayfiles` only scans the results of these tools (`gau`, `waymore`, `waybackurls`, etc) or any other file or directory that you specify. You are free to use it however you want.

# Installation
If Go is installed and in your PATH then just run: 
```bash
go install github.com/Rffrench/wayfiles@latest
```

# Usage
```bash
Usage of wayfiles:
  -e string
    	Exclude certain extensions to search for in the format of: ext1,ext2,ext3 E.g.: -e db,pdf,doc
  -ext
    	Print the list of extensions by default
  -f string
    	File/path for either a file with URLs or a directory with Wayback Machine results. (E.g.: wayfiles -f urls.txt | wayfiles -f ~/waymore/results | wayfiles -f .)
  -h	Prints help menu
  -i string
    	Include extra extensions to search for in the format of: ext1,ext2,ext3 E.g.: -i php,js,aspx
  -l string
    	Use a custom list with extensions instead of using the default ones. The list must include one extension per line. E.g: php (newline) js (newline) aspx (newline) etc
  -s	Silent/Pipable mode. Not verbose mode. Just print the URLs to stdout
  -version
    	Print version number

```
<br>

# Examples

### Simple usage
The most **basic way** of using `wayfiles` is by specifying the `-f` flag. This flag is **REQUIRED** and is used to specify a file or folder to search for files.

```bash
wayfiles -f <file/folder>
```

<br>

### Including extensions
A default list of extensions is included for you, but you can also **include extra extensions** using the `-i` flag separated by a comma:

```bash
wayfiles -f <file/folder> -i js,php,aspx
```

<br>

### Excluding extensions
Same if you want to **exclude certain extensions** of the default list:

```bash
wayfiles -f <file/folder> -e yml,env,json
```
***NOTE: flags `-i` and `-e` can be used in conjunction.*** üíØ

<br>

### Using a custom list of extensions
Or if you want to use your own **list of extensions** you can do so with the `-l` flag and a list containing each extension in a different line:

**Example list:**
```txt
js
php
aspx
```

```bash
wayfiles -f <file/folder> -l extensions.txt
```

<br>

### Piping output (silent mode)
Finally, `wayfiles` has also been designed to be used in conjuction with other tools such as `httpx`. Results can be piped to other tools by using the flag `-s` and print only the URLs found.

```bash
wayfiles -f <file/folder> -s
```

<br>

# List of default extensions
You can print the list of default extensions by running:

```bash
wayfiles -ext
```

If you have any suggestions of adding or removing extensions please reach out.

I have dediced to include a table with each extension included and its description. Note that not every extension is sensitive by default:
